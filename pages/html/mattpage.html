				<p>
          				 Play the only game where the rules are completely dependent on your actions. <br>
	   				 Choose between creating a rule and making a move to earn points. <br>
	   				 Play with up to four people on a completely randomised grid.
				</p>
				<p>
					Features a dynamic turn amount, playgrid, points balancing, and a completely original award-winning soundtrack. <br>
					The ever-changing list of rules and illusory sprite movement means that players must consider their choices wisely. <br>
					As the game goes on, and the rule list grows, only the player with the most points will claim victory in Click to Continue.
